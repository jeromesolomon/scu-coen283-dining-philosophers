# Dining Philosophers Solution

This is a multi-threaded solution to the Dining Philosopheres problem written in C#.  The solution simulates both the deadlocked condition (without using monitor) and a solution by using a Monitor to allow only one philosopher to eat at a time (one thread to enter the monitor). 

The simulator was written in C# for a homework assignment in a graduate operating systems course at Santa Clara University with Professor Amr Elkady.  It may serve as a good example of how to use monitors in C# for other people.
